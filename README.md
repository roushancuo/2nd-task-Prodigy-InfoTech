 there are a few improvements and considerations you might want to keep in mind:

1. **Security**: The encryption method you're using is quite simple, adding a constant value to each pixel. This is susceptible to basic attacks. For better security, you might want to explore more robust encryption algorithms like AES.

2. **Key Management**: In real-world scenarios, key management is crucial. You might want to consider how keys are generated, stored, and exchanged securely.

3. **Error Handling**: It's always good practice to include error handling in your code, especially when dealing with file operations or image processing.

4. **User Interaction**: If you plan to expand this into a more user-friendly tool, you could add functionality for users to input their own image paths and keys.

5. **Testing**: Ensure to test your code thoroughly with different types of images and keys to ensure it works as expected in various scenarios.
